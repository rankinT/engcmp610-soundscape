# Soundscape in a Storm 

## Introduction
For this soundscape, I originally envisioned it to be sounds of studying that would be occasionally interrupted by background sounds. Those background sounds would be a sort of vehicle for an abstract storyline that culminates in some kind of twist ending. So, something like small background bumps on the wall that would eventually lead to a house explosion after they get ignored for a period of time.

Then as I worked on this project during the night, I got inspired to make it a spooky stormy soundscape where the background storm sounds change the foreground music and make you uneasy because you lose the comfort the music provides. But the twist is that the storm sounds become comforting in the end and you can let yourself zone into it instead of being uneasy.

I did some volume control on the main BGM and did some recordings of study sounds (pencil, paper, keyboard). I also wanted to switch into a spooky vibe so I'll be using background sounds to play with the BGM being the representation of mental

### Environment Sounds
I decided to omit the studying sounds and wanted to go for a narrative dynamic between foreground/background music and weather. And in this project, I wanted to avoid sample sounds as much as possible so aside from the music, I used a mix of my own recorded sounds to get the weather effects.

### Glitches and Static
As part of the narrative that I want this soundscape to follow, I wanted to interrupt the music that comforts you during storm. I was able to get the glitch effect by using the distortion, phaser, and reverse effects.

### How to End
To end the narrative in my soundscape, I felt like having the irony of the storm become your comforting point a opposed to the music would be a nice twist. In the beginning the music was your anchor, but the end realization is that it was the storm all along. So I silenced the music to leave you alone with the storm and did a fade out for each track. Like you could imagine closing your eyes and being all zen-zone with the softer storm sounds.

## Reflection
Trying to only use my own recorded sounds proved to be a fun challenge when I couldn't find the right situations to record in real life. The biggest problem was trying to record the weather sounds of rain and thunder. To improvise, I recorded my shower and distorted air blowing onto the microphone to attempt to emulate the weather.

To get the weather to mess with the music, I used a big thunder sound that would be clip on the track to make the (real and soundscape) listener uncomfortable. Then I also added distortion, phaser, and reverse effects on the music to make it sound like the music glitched out from the close lightning strike. I also recorded myself blowing into the microphone through my shirt and added distortion to get the sound of static. I found that using the envelope tool to make sharp rises and drops in volume, combined with the fade-out effect was very helpful in controlling the volume at specific timings.

When I presented my soundscape, I was very interested in and surprised by peopleâ€™s interpretations without my explanation to influence them. I learned that very abstract concepts need to be supported by a contextual commentary. From my perspective as the creator, there was a bias for how I expected the soundscape to be interpreted which was completely different from what people actually thought of it. For reference, I thought the recorded shower sounds were a convincing replacement for real rain sounds, but it seems that was not the case because people had pictured the soundscape in a bathroom with shower sounds. And I also intended to remove the explosion part from my narrative, but the thunder sounds were still interpreted as explosions in the bathroom. As a future update, I might consider trying to record real rain sounds by my window instead.
