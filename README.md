# Soundscape in a Storm 
For this soundscape, I originally envisioned it to be sounds of studying that would be occasionally interrupted by background sounds. Those background sounds would be a sort of vehicle for an abstract storyline that culminates in some kind of twist ending. So, something like small background bumps on the wall that would eventually lead to a house explosion after they get ignored for a period of time.

But then as I worked on this project during vampire hours, I got inspired to make it a spooky stormy soundscape where the background sounds give you the feeling of when you think you’re alone in the house at night, but then you hear some weird sounds that make you doubt it…

I did some volume control on the main BGM and did some recordings of study sounds (pencil, paper, keyboard). I also wanted to switch into a spooky vibe so I'll be using background sounds to play with the BGM being the representation of mental

### Environment Sounds
I decided to omit the studying sounds and wanted to go for a narrative dynamic between foreground/background music and weather. And in this project, I wanted to avoid sample sounds as much as possible so aside from the music, I used a mix of my own recorded sounds to get the weather effects.

### Glitches and Static
As part of the narrative that I want this soundscape to follow, I wanted to interrupt the music that comforts you during storm. I was able to get the glitch effect by using the distortion, phaser, and reverse effects.

### How to End
To end the narrative in my soundscape, I felt like having the irony of the storm become your comforting point a opposed to the music would be a nice twist. In the beginning the music was your anchor, but the end realization is that it was the storm all along. So I silenced the music to leave you alone with the storm and did a fade out for each track. Like you could imagine closing your eyes and being all zen-zone with the softer storm sounds.
